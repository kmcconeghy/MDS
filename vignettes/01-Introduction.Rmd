Welcome to mdsR! This program was written as a tool for academic work performed by researchers at Brown University. The primary objective was to develop a suite of personalized functions, some of which will only work with data housed by the Brown School of Public Health. We drew from many sources which are acknowledged and cited throughout in the development of this package.
